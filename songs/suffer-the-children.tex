\beginsong{Suffer the children}[by=Tears For Fears]

\beginverse
\[G] It's a sad affair,
\[G7] when there's no one there,
\[C] He calls out in the n\[G]ight.

And it's so unfair,
\[G7] at least it seems that way,
\[C] when you gave him his \[G]life.
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[F]all this time he's been getting you down,
You ought to\[C] pick him up when there's no one around,
And con\[F]vince him,
Oh just \[C]talk to him,
Cause he \[F]knows in his heart you won't be home soon,
And he's an\[C] only child in an only room
And he's de\[F]pendent on you
Oh he's de\[C]pendent on you
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ And it seems so strange,
^ That at the end of the day,
^ Making love can be so ^good,

But the pain of birth,
^ Oh what is it worth,
When it don't ^turn out the way that it ^should
\endverse
