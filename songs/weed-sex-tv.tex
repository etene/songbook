\beginverse
Tryin' not to ^lose it,^ finding what the ^truth is

Tone my ego ^down, this ^tug o' war spirit ^asking
The time that you came a^round
^ is when I really needed ^balance

Turn off the TV right ^now
^ 'cause you're the one with all the ^talent

All I ever do is try
^Hearing you out when you've got a problem you know that you ^can speak it to me

Tired of ^9-5 too much time this regular life been taking from me

I ^gotta slide when I know you're coming like ^medication for me

I ^take a ride, I am so over this week
