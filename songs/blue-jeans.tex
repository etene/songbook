\beginverse
\[Em] Blue jeans,\[D] white shirt
\[A]Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, \[Em] James Dean, \[D] for sure
\[A]You so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
\[Em]You were sorta punk rock, \[D]{I grew up} on hip hop
\[A]But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
\[Em] That love is mean,\[D] and love hurts
But \[A]{I still} remember that day we met in December, oh baby!
\endverse

\beginchorus
^ I will love you ^till the end of ^time
I would wait a million ^years
Promise you'll re^member that you're ^mine
Baby can you see through the tears
^ Love you more,^ than those bitches before
^Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
^ I will love you ^till the end of ^time
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ Big dreams,^ gangster	
^Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: "^No please", "^Stay here"
^"We don't need no money we can make it all work"
But he ^headed out on Sunday, ^said he'd come home Monday
I ^stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he was
^ Chasing, ^ paper
"C^aught up in the game" that was the last I heard
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}

\beginverse
\[Em]{He went out every night}, and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side\[D]
Cause I'm a ride or die, whether you fail or fly,
Well shit at least you tried
\endverse
\beginverse
But when you walked out that \[Em]door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more, but that not what I had in mind
I just want it like \[D]before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...
\endverse
