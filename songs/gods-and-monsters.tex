\beginsong{Gods and monsters}[by=Lana del Rey]

\beginverse*
In the l\[Am]and of gods and \[Dm]monsters
I was an \[G]angel
Living in the garden of e\[Am]vil
Screwed up, scared, \[Dm]doing anything that I nee\[G]ded
Shining like a fiery b\[Am]eacon
You got that me\[Dm]dicine that I need\[G]
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly\[Am]
Put your hands on my \[Dm]waist do it softly
\[G]Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F] No one's gonna \[Dm]take my soul a\[Am]way
Living like \[G]Jim Morrison\[F]
Heading towards a \[Dm]fucked up holid\[Am]ay
Motel, sprees, s\[G]prees, and I'm singing

\[F]Fuck yeah, give it to me
\[Dm]This is heaven what I truly \[Am]want
\[G]Is innocence lost ?\[F] \[Dm]
Innocence lost ?\[Am] \[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse
In the l^and of gods and ^monsters
I was an an^gel
Looking to get fucked hard^
Like a groupie inco^gnito posing as a real sin^ger
Life imitates art^
You got that ^medicine that I need^
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please^
I don't really wanna know ^what's good for me^
God's dead, I said ``Baby that's alright with me``
\endverse
\textnote{Refrain}
\beginverse
\[Am]When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me c\[G]razy
'Cause life imitates art\[Am]
If I get a little \[Dm]prettier, can I be your \[G]baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard
\endverse
