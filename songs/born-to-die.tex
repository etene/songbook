\beginverse
\[G]Feet don't fail me \[D]now
\[G]Take me to the finish \[D]line
All my heart, it \[C]breaks every step that I t\[Em]ake
But I'm hoping that the \[D]gates,	
They'll tell me that you're mine
\endverse

\beginverse
^Walking through the city s^treets
^Is it by mistake or de^sign
I feel so a^lone on a Friday n^ight
Can you make it feel like ^home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey
\endverse

\beginchorus
\memorize[chorus]
\[C]Don't make me \[Em]sad, don't make me \[D]cry
Sometimes love is not e\[Cmaj7]{nough when} the road gets tough
I don't know \[C]why
Keep making me \[Em]laugh,
Let's go get \[D]high
Road's long, we carry \[Cmaj7]on
Try to have fun in the mean\[C]time
Come and take a walk on the wild side\[Em]
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring \[D]rain
You like your girls in\[Cmaj7]sane
\[C] Choose your last w\[Em]ords
This is the last \[D]time
Cause you and \[C]{I, we} were born to \[Cmaj7]die
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Lost but now I am f^ound
^{I can} see but once I was b^lind
I was so con^fused as a little ch^ild	
Tried to take what I could g^et
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey
\endverse
