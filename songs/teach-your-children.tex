\beginverse
\[D]You, who are on the \[G]road,
must have a \[D]code that you can \[A]live by

And \[D]so, become your\[G]self,
because the \[D]past is just a \[A]goodbye
\endverse

\beginverse
^Teach, your children ^well,
their father's ^hell did slowly ^go by

And ^feed, them on your ^dreams,
the one they ^fix, the one you'll ^know by
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]Don't you ever ask them \[G]why,
if they told you you will \[D]cry

So just look at them and s\[Bm]i\[G]gh, \[A]
and know they \[D]love you
\endchorus

\beginverse
And ^you, of tender ^years,
can't know the ^fears that your elders ^grew by

And so, please, ^help them with your ^youth,
they seek the ^truth before they ^can die
\endverse

\beginverse
^Teach, your parents ^well,
their children's ^hell will slowly ^go by

And ^feed them on your ^dreams
the one they ^fix, the one you'll ^know by
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}
