\beginsong{All good things come to an end}[by={Nelly Furtado}]


\beginverse
\[Am]Honestly what will be\[C]come of me
Don't like re\[G]ality
It's way too \[F]clear to me, but

\[Am]Really life is \[C]dandy
We are what \[G]we don't see
Miss every\[F]thing daydreaming
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Am] Flames to d\[C]ust
Lovers to f\[G]riends
Why do \[F]all good things come to an \[Am]end

\[Am] Flames to d\[C]ust
Lovers to f\[G]riends
Why do \[F]all good things come to an \[Am]end

come to an \[C]end come to an\[G]

Why do \[F]all good things come to \[Am]end?
come to an \[C]end come to an\[G]
Why do \[F]all good things come to an end?
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Traveling I only stop at ^exits
Wondering if I'll ^stay
Young and ^restless living this way I stress less

^{I want} to pull away when the ^dream dies
The pain sets in and ^{I don't} cry
I only feel ^gravity and I wonder why
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}

\beginverse
Well the ^dogs were whistling a ^new tune
Barking at the ^new moon
Hoping it would \[G]come soon so that they could

\[Am]Dogs were whistling a \[C]new tune

Barking at the \[G]new moon
Hoping it would \[G]come soon so that they could \[F]die

\[E]die \[F]die \[G]die
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}

\beginverse
Well the ^dogs were barking at a ^new moon
Whistling a ^new tune
Hoping it would ^come soon

And the ^sun was wondering if ^it should 
stay away for ^a day til the feeling ^went away

\endverse
\beginverse
And the ^{sky was} falling on the ^clouds were 
dropping and the ^rain forgot how to ^bring salvation

the ^dogs were barking at the ^new moon
Whistling a ^new tune
Hoping it would ^come soon so that they could \[Am]die.
