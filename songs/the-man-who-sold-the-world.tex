\beginsong{The man who sold the world}[by=Nirvana]

\beginverse
\[F] We passed upon the s\[A7]tairs
We spoke of was and when\[Dm]

Although I wasn't \[A7]there
He said I was his friend\[F]

Which came as a sur\[C]prise
I spoke into his \[A]eyes

I thought you died a\[Dm]lone
A long, long time a\[C]go
\endverse

\beginchorus
Who k\[C5]nows, not \[F]me
We \[C#5]never lost con\[F]trol

You're \[C5]face, to \[F]face
With the \[C#5]{man who} sold the world
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ I laughed and shook his h^and
Made my way back home^

I searched for form and ^land
For years and years, I roamed^

I gazed a gazeless s^tare
We walked a million h^ills

I must have died a^lone
A long, long time a^go
