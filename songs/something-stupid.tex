\beginsong{Something Stupid}[by={Frank Sinatra}]

\beginverse*
I \[G]know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend a \[Am]evening with \[D]me, \[Am] \[D7]
And \[Am]{if we go} someplace to dance I know that there's a \[D7]chance you won't be \[G]leaving with me.
\endverse
\beginverse
And \[G7]afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a \[C]drink or two, \[Cm]
And \[Am]then I go and \[D]spoil it all by \[Am]saying something \[D7]stupid like ``I \[G]love you``. \[C9]
\endverse
\beginverse
I can \[G7]see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies you heard the \[C]night before,
And \[A]though it's just a line to you for me it's \[A7]true it never seemed so \[D]right before. \[D7]
\endverse
\beginverse
I \[G]practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the \[Am]meaning come \[D]true, \[Am] \[D7]
But \[Am]then I think I'll wait until the \[D7]evening gets late  and I'm a\[G]lone with you.
\endverse
\beginverse
The \[G7]time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red and oh the \[C]night's so blue, \[Cm]
And \[Am]then I go and \[D]spoil it all by \[Am]saying something \[D7]stupid like ``I \[G]love you``. \[C9]
\endverse
