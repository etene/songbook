\beginverse
\[D]When I walk beside her I \[C]am the better man

When I \[G]look to leave her

I always \[D]stagger back again
\endverse
\beginverse
^Once I built an ivory tower

So I could ^worship from above

When I ^climbed down to be set free

^She took me in again
\endverse
\beginchorus
There's a \[D]big, a big hard \[Am]sun

Beating on the big \[G]people
In the big \[D]hard world
\endchorus
\beginverse
^When she comes to greet me

She is ^mercy at my feet

When I ^see her bitter charm

She just ^throws it back at me
\endverse
\beginverse
Once I ^dug an early grave

To ^find a better land

^She just smiled and laughed at me

And took her ^blues back again
\endverse
\textnote{Refrain} \rep{2}
\beginverse
When I ^go to cross that river

She is ^comfort by my side

^When I try to understand

She just ^opens up her hands
\endverse
\textnote{Refrain} 
\beginverse
Once I ^stood to lose her
When I ^saw what I had done

^Bound down and threw away the hours
Of her ^garden and her sun
\endverse
\beginverse
So I ^tried to warn her
I ^turned to see her weep

^Forty days and forty nights
And it's still ^coming down on me
\endverse
\textnote{Refrain à volonté}
