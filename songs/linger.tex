\beginverse
If \[D]you, if you could return

Don't let it \[A]burn, don't let it fade

I'm sure I'm not being \[C]rude

But it's just your attitude

It's tearing me a\[G]part

It's ruining every day
\endverse

\beginverse
I ^swore, I swore I would be true

And honey so did ^you

So why were you holding her ^hand?

Is that the way we stand?

Were you lying all the ^time?

Was it just a game to you?

\endverse

\beginchorus
But I'm in so ^deep
You know I'm such a ^fool for you

You got me wrapped around your ^finger

Do you have to let it ^linger?

\lrep Do you have to,\rrep \rep{3} let it \[D]linger?
\endchorus

\beginverse
Oh, I \[A]thought the world of you

I thought \[C]nothing could go wrong

But I was wrong, I was \[G]wrong, I was wrong

\endverse

\beginverse
If ^you, if you could get by

Trying not to ^lie

Things wouldn't be so con^fused

And I wouldn't feel so used

But you always really ^knew

I just want to be with you
\endverse

\beginchorus
And I'm in so ^deep
You know I'm such a ^fool for you

You got me wrapped around your ^finger

Do you have to let it ^linger?

\lrep Do you have to,\rrep \rep{3} let it \[D]linger?
\endchorus
