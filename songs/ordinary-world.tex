\beginverse
C\[Am]ame in from a rainy Thursday \[C]on the ave\[D]nue,
t\[Am]hought I heard you talking softly \[C] \[D]
\[Am]{I turned} on the lights, the tv \[C]and the ra\[D]dio,
\[Am]still I can't escape the ghost of y\[C]ou \[D]
W\[Am]{hat has} happened to it all? \[Em]Crazy, some say
Wh\[B7]{ere is} the life that I reco\[C]gnize? \echo{Gone away}
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G] But I won't cry for yester\[Dm]day
There's an ordinary \[F]world
Somehow I have to f\[C]ind

\[G] And as I try to make my \[Dm]way 
To the ordinary \[F]world
I will learn to sur\[Dm]vive
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Passion or coincidence once p^rompted you to s^ay
"^Pride will tear us both apart" ^ ^
Well, now ^pride's gone out the window, cross the ^rooftops, runa^way,
^left me in the vacuum of my he^art ^
W^hat is happening to me?
C^razy, some say
Wh^{ere is} my friend when I need you m^ost? \echo{Gone away}
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}

\beginverse
^Papers in the roadside tell of ^suffering and gr^eed,
^feared today, forgot tomorrow ^ ^
Ooh, ^here beside the news of holy ^war and holy n^eed,
^ours is just a little sorrowed t^alk ^
\endverse

\textnote{Refrain}
