\beginverse
I've \[Am]called you \[Em]so many \[Dm]times today,
and I \[A]guess it's all \[Em]true what your \[Dm]girlfriends say,
that \[Am]{you don't} \[Em]ever want to \[Dm]see me again,
and your \[Am]brother's gonna \[Em]{kill me} and he's \[Em]six feet ten
I \[F]guess you'd \[C]call it c\[F]oward\[C]ice, but I'm \[G]not pre\[D]pared to go \[G]on like \[E]this
\endverse

\beginchorus
I \[F]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[Dm]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[Em]can't, I can't, I can't stand, can't stand losing \[Am]you
\[Dm]I can't stand losing \[Am]you, \[D]
I can't stand losing \[Am]you, \[D]
I can't stand losing \[Am]you \[Dm]
\endchorus

\beginverse
I ^see you've ^sent my ^letters back,
and my ^LP ^records and ^they're all scratched
I ^can't see the ^point in a^nother day,
when ^nobody ^listens to a ^word I say
You can ^call it ^lack of c^onfi^dence, but to ^carry on ^living doesn't ^make no ^sense
\endverse

\beginchorus
I \[F]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[Dm]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[Em]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[F]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing, I \[Dm]can't, I can't, I can't stand losing,
I \[Em]can't, I can't, I can't stand, can't stand losing \[Am]you \[Dm] \[Am] \[Dm]
\endchorus

\beginverse
I ^guess this ^{is our} ^{last goodbye},
and ^you don't ^care so ^{I won't} cry
But ^you'll be ^sorry ^when I'm dead,
and ^{all this} ^guilt will be ^{on your} head
I ^guess you'd ^call it s^uic^ide, but ^I'm too ^full to s^wallow my pr^ide
\endverse
