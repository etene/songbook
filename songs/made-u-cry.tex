\beginverse
I \[B]can't for\[C]get your s\[A]mile
When I \[D]looked you \[E]in the \[C]eyes
% le C c'est un septièe ou un truc du genre
You're so \[C]pretty when u lie
And it's your \[G]heat that gets me high
When i'm \[F]coming down
You're \[C]always hard to \[F]find \[C]
\endverse
\beginverse
I ^don't for^get your s^mile
Your ^lips in ^black and ^white
Sus^pended in my mind
When i come ^lookin you're offline
Like ^makin love
With the ^movie of your ^life ^
\endverse
\beginchorus
Satan watches \[E]u, my \[F]handsome mes\[D]siah
Satan watches \[E]u, my \[F]lantern \[D]boy
Satan watches \[E]u, my \[F]lavender d\[G]iamond
And i made u \[F]cry
It remains on my \[G]mind
\endchorus
\beginverse
I ^don't for^get your s^mile
^These days ^i'm so ^tired
Just a^nother night to sigh alone
Another ^reason not to try
^Doesn't mean
That i'm ^any less a^live
\endverse
\beginchorus
Satan watches \[E]u, my \[F]honest \[D]dolphin
Seeing how the \[E]see was \[F]watching \[D]god
Satan washes \[E]all, all \[F]outta my \[G]mind
And i made u \[F]cry
A\[G]nother heartbreak fantasy
\endchorus
\beginverse
In the \[C]tide
Save your \[C#]certainty
It's all a game to \[C]me
It's only satan's \[C#]dream
Somehow it's not \[C]all lost
Get on satan's \[C#]team
Someone to carry \[C]me
Someone to say to \[C#]me
It's all been done
\[C]For my safety
Oh \[C#]yeah But it's your fantasy too
\[D]Side to side
A \[D#]lemon an its \[E]seed
\[F]
