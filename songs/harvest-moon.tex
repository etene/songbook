\[Em7] Come a little bit closer,
hear what I have to\[D]{ say} \[Dmaj7] \[D] \[Dmaj7]
\[Em7] Just like children sleeping,
we could dream this night a\[D]way \[Dmaj7] \[D] \[Dmaj7]
\[G] But thereâ€™s a full moon rising,
let's go dancing in the \[D]light \[Bm] \[Dmaj7]
\[D] \[Bm] \[Dmaj7]
\[G] We know where the music's playing,
let's go out and feel the \[D]night \[Bm] \[Dmaj7]
\[D] \[Bm] \[Dmaj7]

\beginchorus
\[Em7] Because I'm still in love with \[A7]you,
I want to see you dance a\[Em7]gain
Because I'm still in love with \[A7]you, on this harvest \[D]moon \[Bm] \[Dmaj7] \[D] \[Bm] \[Dmaj7]

\beginverse
^ When we were strangers,
I watched you from a^far ^ ^ ^
^ When we were lovers,
I loved you with all my he^art ^ ^ ^
^ But now it's getting late
and the moon is climbing h^igh ^ ^
^ ^ ^
^ I want to celebrate,
see it shining in your ^eye ^ ^
